# C---project

This is my project. As you can see, it was written using C++. 
It took some trouble getting it to work. I had to install and download a ton of compilers to get anything to work, and, as you can probably tell, I'm still struggling with some of the details.
It's about the same level as C#, being a close ancestor of it. 
It's a Strongly typed programming language.
I chose this language because, well, I like a challenge. Plus it's used by a lot of software developers, including those who make apps. Since I'm considering going into building apps, and quite a few apps are made with C++, it seemed like a good choice.
I've mostly been using the W3 tutorials for this. 
And...that's about it.
